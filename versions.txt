30/07/2010 - mIRC v7.1

Changes:
1.This is the first stable release of the new Unicode version of mIRC.

  The project to convert mIRC to Unicode has taken almost two years of
  development and testing and has required tens of thousands of changes
  to 150,000+ lines of source code. This has been the most complex and
  time-consuming update to mIRC since it was created in 1995, when it
  started out as a non-Unicode, 16-bit, Windows 3.1 application.

  Many areas of mIRC have had to be updated or re-written, from file
  handling to text processing, from display to memory allocation, from
  server communications to file transfers.

  mIRC should now be faster, more stable, and more compatible with
  the latest versions of Windows, and should be able to better handle
  the display and input of a variety of languages.

  In addition to being converted to Unicode, there are a few other
  notable changes:

  Improved Windows 7 compatibility
  More reliable INI file handling
  Faster text display/scrolling
  Speech support
  Improved interface design for a number of features
  Automatic text color correction
  Menubar Alt key show/hide feature
  Support for italic text and other font styles
  Optimized SSL routines
  Status window SSL connection icon
  IPv6 support
  Improved portable support
  Persistent channel history
  Digitally signed executables
  Automatic splitting of long channel/private messages
  Full screen display with F11 function key
  UPnP support
  Many bug fixes
  And more

  For a full version history of mIRC v7.x development, please see the
  list of changes starting with v7.0.

   parameter correctly in text that contains Unicode and UTF-8.
11.Fixed variables not being sorted correctly when sort button is used
   in script editor.
12.Added /bwrite -t switch, interprets text value as plain text and
   does not evaluate &binbar variables.

28/05/2010 - mIRC v7.04

Changes:
1.Added UPnP support. The Ports dialog allows you to enable UPnP
  support for retrieving your external IP address, the identd server,
  DCC connections, and the DCC server. The first three options are
  enabled by default.

  mIRC marks UPnP ports that it opens as "mIRC". It closes UPnP ports
  the moment they are no longer needed.

  If mIRC is connecting to multiple servers at the same that use both
  IPv4 and IPv6, the UPnP port for the identd server will only be able
  to handle either IPv4 or IPv6 at any one time, since a UPnP port can
  only be bound to one address.

  If you make any changes to the UPnP options in the Ports dialog, mIRC
  performs a quick check to see if UPnP is available and will warn you
  if it is not.

2.Added /socklisten -p switch to enable UPnP support for a listening
  socket.
3.Changed hotlink feature to handle more formats.
4.Fixed /clear -g switch bug.
5.Optimized display routine to use bitmap caching more efficiently.
6.Changed the way a server connection is closed after sending /quit to
  make disconnection more robust/graceful.
7.Added check for empty servers list. If servers list is empty, mIRC
  looks for the "defaults" folder and copies the servers.ini from
  there to the data folder.

20/05/2010 - mIRC v7.03

Changes:
1.Changed DCC Send/Get windows to show long progress bar when window
  is maximized.
2.Changed DCC Send/Get switchbar buttons to display progress bar in
  black during transfer and grey when finished.
3.Fixed /fseek line matching bugs.
4.Optimized BOM-checking in file routines, should have minimal impact
  on read/write speed now.
5.Fixed $dns().ip bug when resolving an IP address.
6.Changed Control+N back to shortcut for channel switching.
7.Added "Split long channel/query messages" option to Messages dialog.
  If a message is long enough that it might be chopped by the maximum
  server line length, it is sent as mutliple lines.
8.Fixed font bug with reading font settings from mirc.ini.
9.Optimized display routine, should be faster in some situations.
10.Changed richedit editbox support back to riched20.dll since it
   seems to be faster and more reliable overall.
11.Optimized the way scripts are loaded into script editor editbox.
12.Fixed ini file handling bug when reading section/item/data that
   are enclosed in quotes.
13.Fixed hotlink feature not handling single-word hostnames.
14.Changed $utfencode/$utfdecode to return input text if they are
   unable to encode/decode the text instead of returning an error.
15.Changed the way the file routines set end-of-file and error, should
   behave more like older versions now.
16.Added /raw -n switch to prevent characters in the range 0-255 being
   UTF-8 encoded when sent to the server. Also added a $rawbytes
   identifier that returns the incoming server message prior to any
   parsing/decoding.

01/05/2010 - mIRC v7.02

Changes:
1.Added Unicode/UTF-8 BOM support to file routines. This applies to all
  files that are read or written as text, including ini files.
2.Changed DCC Send/Get windows to allow full filename to be viewed when
  window is resized.
3.Changed DCC Get to open download file with exclusive write access.
4.Added support for detecting Wine so that mIRC can use alternative
  code for features that need it. Around fifteen separate workarounds
  were implemented. Features that could not be made to work reliably
  (richedit editbox support and playing mp3 and mid files) are now
  disabled.
5.Changed mouse wheel scroll method in the script editor editbox to
  allow faster/smoother scrolling.
6.Fixed system shell DDE messages bug.
7.Changed font-linking implementation slightly, should be faster and
  support more characters.
8.Added support for /dns $server to fill $serverip for SOCKS5 users,
  though note that this results in a DNS leak.
9.Fixed treebar background update bug.
10.Optimized display routine, should now be faster when displaying
   control codes.
11.Fixed $regml().pos bug.
12.Added Names dialog back to Display options dialog.
13.Fixed /sockudp -k bug.
14.Fixed line colors parsing bug when reloading log files.
15.Fixed query flood check bug.

15/04/2010 - mIRC v7.01

Changes:
1.Changed the way fonts are set for editboxes in windows and in the
  script editor. This should resolve issues for users who are seeing
  the font change when they enter text.
2.Changed the foregound/background color correction feature so that it
  no longer applies if a ^K background color is specified.
3.Fixed /filter gpf bug.
4.Fixed /fopen gpf bug.
5.Changed $input() icons default sound behavior.
6.Fixed text display bug where last character was not entirely visible
  in some situations with certain fonts.

  Unicode character was used in the format string.
9.Changed numeric 451 "You have not registered" message for the "CAP"
  request to no longer be displayed when connecting to a server.
10.Fixed DDE support. Most applications, such as web browsers, can only
   reply to ANSI DDE requests, so mIRC now sends DDE requests in ANSI
   as opposed to Unicode. mIRC can now reply to both Unicode and ANSI
   DDE requests.
11.Changed identd default behavior when choosing userid from email
   address or identd userid field.
12.Fixed $ini()/loadbuf combination bug that was fixing/updating an
   incorrectly formatted ini file even though it was only being read
   by the script.

02/04/2010 - mIRC v7.0

Changes:
1.mIRC is now a Unicode application.
2.mIRC now uses its own custom ini routines to ensure more reliable
  ini file handling. They should work almost identically to the
  standard Windows ini routines.
3.Changed the way microsoft agent is detected by checking for folder
  instead of loading agent to cater for Windows 7 issue.
4.Added a bitmap cache to speed up window text display. Depending on
  the font you are using, your cleartype settings, and/or your cpu
  speed, you should see a significant increase in display speed of text
  in all windows.
5.Fixed script editor not filling as much of the editbox buffer as
  it could (up to maximum size of 500k) when reading a file.
6.Updated to PCRE library v8.02 and enabled Unicode/UTF-8 support.
7.Fixed /drawrot gpf bug.

12.Fix internal http routines not handling redirects correctly.
13.Updated to SAPI5+ speech and voice commands to make them work with
   Windows 7.
14.Added Speech dialog to Sounds dialog. This replaces the Agents dialog
   which is no longer supported by Windows 7. If mIRC notices that
   Agents are available on your version of Windows, the Agents dialog
   option will still be available.
15.Added /speak -spclu [speed] [pitch] [text] command which speaks the
   specified text, where the switches are:

   -s = speed (0 to 100)
   -p = pitch (0 to 100)
   -c = clear all queued lines
   -l = apply lexicon settings in speech dialog.
   -u = apply option settings in speech dialog

   You can use $speak(N) to list all lines that are currently queued
   for speaking through the /speak command. If N = 0, returns total
   number of queued lines.

16.Extended maximum incoming server line length from 600 to 1024
   bytes.
17.Fixed default notify sounds not being saved with relative path.
18.Fixed popup loading bug when a file contains empty lines.
19.Fixed on CLOSE event bug with status window requiring * prefix.
20.Extended on CLOSE event to work with channels.
21.Changed on OPEN/CLOSE events to handle parameters like other
   similar events. This should not affect existing scripts.
22.Added script editor file menu options "Rename" and "Delete".
23.Added [about] portable=[yes|no] item to mirc.ini that allows you
   to enable portable mode more easily on usb drives.
24.Changed mouse wheel routine to correctly handle faster/slower
   scrolling.
25.Added CAP LS protocol support. mIRC now sends "CAP LS" as the first
   line when connecting to a server before sending NICK/USER to logon.
   Currently enables "multi-prefix" and "packet-size=1024" if they are
   available.
26.Fixed listbox item height in Control/Color/Highlight dialogs.
27.Fixed text display being clipped incorrectly when using certain
   fonts.
28.The Channels List window now updates the horizontal scrollbar
   on-the-fly to avoid the display freeze after listing a large number
   of channels.
29.Fixed some controls not being disabled in Lock dialog when lock is
   enabled.
30.When clicking reset button in Colors dialog, colors are now reset
   to the most recent active settings for that theme.
31.mIRC now skips sending "mode +i" on connect if it has already been
   set automatically by the server.
32.Changed the design of some of the dialogs in the Options dialog,
   the DCC Send/Get dialogs, and others.
33.mIRC no longer requires Full Name and Email Address to be filled
   in the connect dialog and sends default values if left empty.
34.On connecting to a server, if both nick and alternative are in use
   mIRC appends a random number to your nickname and tries again.
35.Changed /debug windows to no longer interpret colors. They now
   display control codes as plain text.
36.Changed USER/NICK logon method to comply with RFC2812.
37.Changed switchbar DCC Send/Get button progress bar, now displays a
   small bar under the text.
38.Optimized Unicode font-linking routines.
39.Now using Visual Studio 2008 to compile mIRC.
40.Added WM_PRINTCLIENT support to a number of controls including the
   toolbar, switchbar, and treebar.
41.Renamed "download" folder to "downloads" in line with other folders.
42.Fixed /debug windows log menu not being set correctly.
43.Fixed mIRC main window system menu not being set correctly when
   the menbuar is disabled.
44.Renamed "Firewall" dialog "Proxy". Replaced /firewall command with
   /proxy although /firewall is still supported.
45.mIRC now disables the proxy if it is enabled in the proxy dialog
   but no address is provided and a SOCKS_HOST environment variable
   does not exist.
46.Added menbuar auto-show/hide feature that displays the menubar
   when you press the Alt key and hides it afterwards.
47.Keyboard focus now automatically switches to the treebar if all
   other windows are minimized.
48.Fixed PCRE gpf bug when expression results in heavy recursion.
49.Changed switchbar to display transparent buttons when a background
   picture is selected.
50.Added support for all available font styles, such as italic and
   semi-bold, in font dialog.
51.Added support for Control+I key combination to make italic text
   using control code 29.
52.Added support for DLLs that use Unicode functions. By default mIRC
   assumes that DLL functions are ANSI for backwards compatibility.
   However a DLL can enable Unicode support by setting mUnicode to
   TRUE in the LOADINFO structure:

   typedef struct {
     DWORD  mVersion;
     HWND   mHwnd;
     BOOL   mKeep;
     BOOL   mUnicode;
   } LOADINFO;

53.Added SendMessage WM_MEVALUATE/WM_MCOMMAND support for Unicode.
   By default mIRC assumes that mapped file data is ANSI for backwards
   compatibility. However an application can "or" the value 8 in the
   cMethod parameter to specify Unicode data.
54.Changed display behavior for a number of dialogs, such as the DCC
   Send/Get dialogs, so that buttons are now disabled for a short time
   when the dialogs are displayed to prevent accidental typing. If the
   user is typing the buttons remain disabled until the user stops.

   Added a 'b' switch to $input() and an "option disable" property to
   custom dialogs that enables this behavior.

55.Fixed treebar display bug when displaying DCC window names.
56.Changed script editor Order dialog to automatically select the
   active script in the listbox on opening.
57.Updated editbox in all windows and script editor to use richedit 4.1
   msftedit.dll for improved Unicode support. If not available reverts
   to riched20.dll.
58.Changed line numbering method in script editor, uses more reliable
   method that is independent of editbox.
59.Changed status window icon to display a yellow lock when on a secure
   connection using SSL.
60.Fixed Control+K color dialog centering bug.
61.Changed servers list sorting method so that the networks listed in
   the [networks] section of servers.ini are now placed at the top.
62.Changed DCC Send/Get transfer windows default font, now uses the
   system dialog font. Also switched to appropriate system font for
   measurements in features such as $input() and popup menus.
63.Changed design of DCC Send/Get transfer windows, interface is now
   clearer and the display updates once a second.
64.Changed flood protection to begin working only after receiving the
   first numeric to prevent logon issues in some situations.
65.Changed design of the File Type warning dialog, now clearer and also
   shows the file extension that was ignored.
66.Optimized the way line indentation works, such as for /echo -iN,
   and other displayed lines.
67.Improved tab and indent spacing measurement method for both fixed
   and non-fixed width fonts.
68.Improved text-wrapping at whole word boundaries, and now wraps at
   both spaces and commas.
69.Numeric 422 "MOTD file is missing" message is no longer displayed
   when first connecting to a server.
70.Fixed proxy errors not being displayed correctly in some situations.
71.Added a bind listbox to the Connect/Options/Ports dialog that lists
   all active networks interfaces for easy selection. It still allows
   you to enter an IP address as well.
72.Updated /dns command, now multi-threaded, resolves concurrently,
   and can return both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. By default, /dns only
   returns IPv4. You can use the switches -46 to return a combination
   of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
73.Added support for IPv6 connections. By default, mIRC will always use
   IPv4, so IPv6 support must be explicitly enabled using one of these
   methods:

   1) Enable IPv6 support in the Connect/Options/Ports dialog. This
   allows mixed IPv4 and IPv6 connections, with IPv6 taking priority
   in DNS resolution. This means that if you try to connect to a server
   that has both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, mIRC will try IPv6 first.

   2) The bind option in the Connect/Options/Ports dialog. If you
   specify an IPv4 or IPv6 adapter/address, DNS resolution and all
   connections will be made based on the adapter/address type. If you
   explicitly specify an IP address for a connection, such as a /server
   or DCC connection, it overrides this setting.

   3) The /server command with switches -46 to force DNS resolution
   to return either IPv4, IPv6, or both. If you specify an IP address,
   it overrides the switches. The server window will use the requested
   DNS method for all subsequent connections until you change it with
   the /server command.

   Note: in order to use IPv6, both your version of Windows and your
   Internet connection must support IPv6.

74.Added $iptype(text) identifier, returns "ipv4" or "ipv6" if text is
   is a valid IP address format. With IPv6 addresses, the properties
   .compress and .expand can be used.
75.Added cue text (optional) to Connect dialog for user name and email
   address.
76.Extended $portfree(port,ip) so that you can specify an ip address.

   adapter name can also be used instead of an ip address.
77.Added $bindip(N|ip) identifier. If N is specified, lists active
   network adapters with properties .name, .ip, .loopback. If an ip
   address is specified, returns best adapter for connecting to that
   ip address.
78.Updated to OpenSSL 0.9.8n library.

   used to run mIRC on a USB flash drive.

   This required the following extension to the DCC transfer protocol:
   If mIRC sees that it is sending or receiving a file with a size
   larger than a 32bit value, it sends and expects to receive 64bit
   acks. In all other respects, the protocol is unchanged. Note that
   all previous versions of mIRC are unable to either send or receive

   scroll the display buffer.

   settings in the User's "Application Data\mIRC" folder by default.

   However, if the installer or mIRC find mirc.ini in the same folder
   as mirc.exe they will use the mirc.exe folder for all settings.

   now only set by the installer. Removed -nouninst command line
   switch since this is no longer applicable.

   Also irc:// links are now only added to the Current User registry,
   not the local machine registry and this is only done when mIRC
   is run, not by the installer.

   The -service command line switch has been removed from the help
   file though it is still supported under 95/98/ME.

31.mIRC no longer uses an internal uninstaller, instead the install
   program now places an uninstall.exe in the mIRC folder.

   alias/identifier.

   for U3_HOST_EXEC_PATH and U3_APP_DATA_PATH environment variables.
37.Fixed ini storage bug when using -portable switch.
38.Changed -portable command line switch behavior. Now makes mIRC
   both 1) avoid use of the registry and 2) use the executable folder

   has been specified. Also added $notify().network.
44.Changed "Received Files" explorer display to show folders pane.
45.Notify/URLs list windows are now displayed in both the treebar
   and the switchbar.
46.Changed the way the notify list window is displayed on connect.

   and context of the menu being created.
55.Changed left-click method on treebar items, it takes one click to
   open and close windows now.
56.Fixed issues with /mkdir and $isdir(). $isdir() will now only
   accept folder names, whereas previously it was accepting filenames
   as well.
57.Changed status window icon so that you can now tell when it is
   connected, connecting, logging on, or disconnecting.
58.Alt+LeftClick no longer changes the status window icon, instead

78.All buttons that select/display files/folders now display the whole
   file/path with ellipsis if necessary.
79.Fixed nick color list freeze issue, instead of updating all nicks
   immediately when colors change, now only updates them when they

80.Moved highlight dialog to address book and added regex support.
81.Fixed options dialog memory leak.
82.Fixed "Move status window..." bug in Group dialog.
83.Fixed wildcard matching bug.
84.Added support for tips, text balloons that pop up near the Windows
   tray to notify you of various events such as incoming messages or
   users in your notify list coming on or leaving IRC.

   Tips only appear when mIRC is not the active application and are
   hidden the moment mIRC becomes active.

   Tips can be configured in the Options/Windows/Options dialog.

   The Highlight dialog in the Address Book also supports tips for
   matched items.

   Tips can also be scripted using the $tip() identifier:

   $tip(name,title,text,delay,iconfn,iconpos,alias,wid)
   Returns Nth position of tip if successful, zero if not.

   name - name of the tip
   title - title
   text - text
   delay - from 3 to 60 seconds
   iconfn - icon filename
   iconpos - icon position in filename
   alias - alias to perform when tip is double-clicked
   wid - id of window to which tip belongs

   name, title, text are required.
   delay, iconfn, iconpos, alias, and wid can be $null.

   $tip(name/N) can be used to list existing tips.

   Notes:

   Right-click in a tip pauses the time-out for all tips.

   Shift+Left-click in a tip closes that tip.

   Double-click in a tip triggers the alias if one is defined,
   or opens the associated window if not.

   The tip automatically fits the text into it and will at most
   widen to quarter of your screen width.

   New tips are queued until older tips time-out. Tips time-out
   at a slower rate if they are not at the head of the queue.

   If no wid is specified, the tip belongs to the status window
   of the currently active connection.

   A tip is closed if the window it belongs to is made active
   or is closed, or if mIRC is made active and the tip belongs
   to an MDI window.

85.Fixed /showmirc -nt bug minimizing mIRC but not activating
   the next application window.
86.Fixed $mp3() not handling Unicode tags correctly.

90.By popular request, changed logging method back to old method, no
   longer uses name.N.log filename format.
91.For new installs the "download" folder is now named "downloads"
   and a "scripts" folder is created by default.
92.Added $ebeeps identifier, returns sounds enabled/disabled state.
93.Updated tab display routines to use XP/Vista themes.
94.Fixed menubar spaces bug, all scripts are now aligned on load
   using same align routine as editor.
95.Removed support for mirc.hlp file on F1 key, only mirc.chm is
   used now.
96.Fixed editor "monitor file changes" bug with .ini files.
97.When run under Vista mIRC now checks for a corresponding virtual
   store folder at startup. Vista creates virtual store folders for
   older non-Vista compatible applications, such as older versions
   of mIRC. If mIRC finds such a folder, it displays a dialog box
   allowing you to retrieve your old mIRC files and settings.
98.Added $sha1(text|&binvar|filename,[N]) identifier, where N = 0
   for plain text (default), 1 for &binvar, 2 for filename.
99.Updated to PNG 1.2.18 and PCRE v7.2 libraries and to OpenSSL
   0.9.8e support files.
100.The about dialog now displays a second page that loads from the
    mIRC website. No information is sent to the server.
101.Fixed custom dialog icon definitions not setting %var values
    correctly on exit.
102.Changed compiler optimization settings resulting in slightly
    larger executable.
103.Added Mode menu item to the View menu in the menubar that allows
    you to switch between Normal and Compact modes. Compact mode
    makes mIRC behave like a messenger with the treebar filling the
    main window, all windows opening on the desktop, and so on.

The full versions.txt file has become too large to include in the
distribution, so only the version information for the last version
or so is being included from now on. You can still download the full
versions.txt file from the mIRC website.
